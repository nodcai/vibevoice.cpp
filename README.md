A C++ inference engine for Microsoft [VibeVoice](https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice), built on
[ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml). Supports both **TTS** (text-to-speech with voice
cloning) and **ASR** (long-form transcription with diarization).

> Status: TTS + ASR pipelines run end-to-end on real model weights, with
> classifier-free guidance for TTS and a working closed-loop self-test
> (TTS → ASR produces real English transcripts of the synthesized audio).

## Quickstart - prebuilt models

We publish quantized GGUFs at [`mudler/vibevoice.cpp-models`](https://huggingface.co/mudler/vibevoice.cpp-models).
Pull them and you're running in two commands:

```bash
# `--recursive` is mandatory - third_party/ggml is a submodule; without
# it cmake configure fails with 'add_subdirectory called with empty
# directory'. If you've already cloned without it:
#     git submodule update --init --recursive
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mudler/vibevoice.cpp && cd vibevoice.cpp

cmake -B build -DVIBEVOICE_BUILD_TESTS=ON && cmake --build build -j

mkdir -p models && hf download mudler/vibevoice.cpp-models --local-dir models

# TTS
./build/bin/vibevoice-cli tts \
  --model     models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
  --voice     models/voice-en-Carter_man.gguf \
  --text "Hello from vibevoice cpp." --out hello.wav

# ASR
./build/bin/vibevoice-cli asr \
  --model     models/vibevoice-asr-q8_0.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
  --audio     hello.wav
```

## Quickstart - convert from upstream

If you want to roll your own (different quant, different voice, etc.):

```bash
# Tokenizer
hf download Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B --local-dir models/qwen2.5
python scripts/convert_tokenizer.py --src models/qwen2.5 --out models/tokenizer.gguf

# Realtime TTS model (~1.9 GB → ~3.8 GB fp32 gguf)
hf download microsoft/VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B --local-dir models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B
python scripts/convert_vibevoice_to_gguf.py \
  --src models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B \
  --out models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B.gguf

# (optional) quantize to Q8_0 - ~50% smaller, no quality loss in the closed-loop test
python scripts/quantize_gguf.py \
  --src models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B.gguf \
  --out models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --type q8_0

# Voice prompt (one of the en-*/de-*/fr-* etc. files in the upstream demo)
curl -sL -o /tmp/voice.pt \
  https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice/raw/main/demo/voices/streaming_model/en-Carter_man.pt
python scripts/convert_voice_to_gguf.py --src /tmp/voice.pt --out models/voice.gguf

./build/bin/vibevoice-cli tts \
  --model models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
  --voice models/voice.gguf \
  --text "Hello from vibevoice cpp." \
  --out hello.wav \
  --cfg 3.0 --steps 20 --max-frames 40 --verbose
```

## Closed-loop sanity (TTS → ASR)

```bash
# 1. synthesize
./build/bin/vibevoice-cli tts \
    --model models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B-q8_0.gguf \
    --voice models/voice-en-Carter_man.gguf \
    --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
    --text "Hello world this is a test of the synthesis system." \
    --seed 12345 --out say.wav

# 2. transcribe back
./build/bin/vibevoice-cli asr \
    --model models/vibevoice-asr-q8_0.gguf \
    --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
    --audio say.wav
# -> [{"Start":0,"End":2.8,"Speaker":0,"Content":"Hello world, this is a test of the synthesis system."}]
```

This is the same roundtrip codified as `tests/test_closed_loop.cpp` - see
[`docs/conversion.md`](docs/conversion.md) for how to wire it into ctest.

## Streaming TTS, post-filter, single gguf (realtime-0.5B)

The realtime model can speak while an LLM is still writing the reply.
`vv::TtsStream` (C++) and `vv_capi_stream_*` (flat C ABI) take text as it
is produced and hand back audio per chunk from a worker thread:

```cpp
vv::TtsStream st;
st.begin(&model, params, [&](const float* pcm, int n) { play(pcm, n); });
st.push_text("Hello there! ");      // as tokens arrive
st.push_text("Welcome to the demo.");
st.end();                           // no more text; join() waits for the tail
```

The first chunk is 3 latent frames (~400 ms of audio) and later chunks grow
by three halves up to 32 frames, so each chunk plays longer than the next
takes to make. On an M4 Max the first chunk arrives about 50-70 ms after the
first five text tokens; a 6 s reply finishes in about 0.5 s.

VibeVoice realtime occasionally puts a short musical artefact in front of
utterances that open with phrases like "Welcome!" or "Hello there". The
library removes it with a [DeepFilterNet3](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet)
post-filter and then trims the lead-in silence, both inside the stream, so
the caller only ever hears speech. The filter's weights ride inside the
model file:

```bash
# once: the DeepFilterNet3 ONNX export as a 4 MB gguf
# python scripts/convert_deepfilternet_to_gguf.py --input <DeepFilterNet3 dir> --output models/deepfilternet3.gguf
python scripts/merge_dfn_gguf.py \
  --model models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --dfn   models/deepfilternet3.gguf \
  --out   models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b-dfn-q8_0.gguf
# or at conversion time: convert_vibevoice_to_gguf.py ... --dfn models/deepfilternet3.gguf

./build/bin/vibevoice-cli tts --model models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b-dfn-q8_0.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf --voice models/voice-en-Emma.gguf \
  --text "Welcome! This starts clean." --steps 3 --cfg 1.7 --stream --out hello.wav
```

For a smaller file, quantize from a full-precision conversion before
merging. The LM layers are only 380 MB of the model; the acoustic decoder's
FFN matrices (604 MB at F16) and an unused 272 MB TTS-LM embedding table are
where the bytes go:

```bash
./build/bin/vibevoice-quantize --src models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B.gguf \
  --out models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b-q8_0.gguf \
  --type q8_0 --decoder-ffn-type q8_0 --head-type q8_0
```

That is 1.1 GB instead of 1.7 GB with the same word error rate and speed;
the q8_0 decoder FFN changes the waveform by under 1%. Quantizing the LM
below q8_0 (`--type q4_k`) costs intelligibility (word error rate 4% to 21%
on a 24-sentence set) and gains no speed, and a q4_k decoder FFN changes the
waveform by ~10%.

With the filter present the output is 48 kHz (its native rate); ask
`vibevoice_tts_output_sample_rate` / `vv_capi_stream_sample_rate` rather
than assuming 24 kHz. `--no-postfilter` and `--no-trim` (and the matching
params) switch either step off. Streaming and batch synthesis produce
bit-identical audio for the same text and seed.

Performance switches, all for A/B, default on: `VIBEVOICE_VAE_V2=0` restores
the legacy conv-transpose decoder (CPU only), `VIBEVOICE_FUSED=0` the
unfused per-step frame loop, `VIBEVOICE_KV_F32=1` F32 K/V caches.
`VIBEVOICE_BENCH=1` prints per-phase timings.

| Stage (M4 Max, Metal, q8_0, 3 steps, CFG 1.7) | before | now |
|---|---:|---:|
| Acoustic decoder per latent frame | did not run on Metal (legacy graph aborts; ~17 ms/frame on CPU) | 3 ms |
| LM + diffusion per frame | 10.3 ms | 5 ms |
| Time to first audio (streamed) | whole reply first | 50-70 ms |
| 6.3 s reply, end to end | 4.6 s on CPU | 0.5 s |

## Quickstart - voice cloning (1.5B)

The `microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B` model conditions on a raw reference WAV
at synthesis time — no separate voice gguf needed. Hand it ~5 s of any
speaker and it'll synthesize new text in that voice.

```bash
hf download microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B --local-dir models/vibevoice-1.5B
python scripts/convert_vibevoice_to_gguf.py \
  --src models/vibevoice-1.5B \
  --out models/vibevoice-1.5B.gguf
# shrink the gguf. Two recommended profiles for the 1.5B path:
#
#   1) Q8_0 across the board: 11 GB -> 6.8 GB, no measurable recall
#      hit on the closed-loop benchmark.
./build/bin/vibevoice-quantize \
  --src  models/vibevoice-1.5B.gguf \
  --out  models/vibevoice-1.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --type q8_0
#
#   2) Mixed: 11 GB -> 6.5 GB, same recall as fp32. FFN at Q6_K, attn
#      at Q5_K, lm_head at Q8_0. Plain Q5_K across the board collapses
#      this model (recall drops to 22%) — FFN weights are the most
#      quant-sensitive piece, attention tolerates Q5_K well.
./build/bin/vibevoice-quantize \
  --src           models/vibevoice-1.5B.gguf \
  --out           models/vibevoice-1.5B-mixed.gguf \
  --type          q6_k    \
  --attn-type     q5_k    \
  --lm-head-type  q8_0

./build/bin/vibevoice-cli tts \
  --model     models/vibevoice-1.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
  --ref-audio reference-voice.wav \
  --text      "Hello world, this is a test of voice cloning." \
  --out       cloned.wav
```

The same `tts` subcommand handles both model families: pass `--voice
<voice.gguf>` for the realtime-0.5B path, or `--ref-audio <wav>` for
runtime voice cloning on the 1.5B path. The CLI dispatches based on
the loaded gguf's variant metadata; the two flags are mutually
exclusive.

**Multi-speaker dialog** (1.5B only): repeat `--ref-audio` per speaker
and tag the lines with `Speaker N:` markers. The model uses each
WAV's encoded features as the voice for the corresponding speaker.

```bash
./build/bin/vibevoice-cli tts \
  --model     models/vibevoice-1.5B-q8_0.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
  --ref-audio voice-carter.wav \
  --ref-audio voice-emma.wav \
  --text "$(printf ' Speaker 0: Hello, I am Carter.\n Speaker 1: And I am Emma.\n Speaker 0: Nice to meet you.')" \
  --out dialog.wav
```

Note: voice cloning **only** works with the 1.5B variant. The
realtime-0.5B weights ship without encoders, so they can't process a
reference WAV at runtime — they only consume pre-baked voice gguf
files (see `scripts/convert_voice_to_gguf.py`).

## Quickstart - ASR

```bash
# ASR model (~14 GB safetensors → ~33 GB fp32 gguf - needs lots of disk)
hf download microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR --local-dir models/vibevoice-asr
python scripts/convert_vibevoice_to_gguf.py \
  --src models/vibevoice-asr \
  --out models/vibevoice-asr.gguf

./build/bin/vibevoice-cli asr \
  --model models/vibevoice-asr.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
  --audio my-clip.wav
# -> [{"Start":0.0,"End":6.0,"Speaker":0,"Content":"..."}]
```

## Benchmarks

Long-form ASR on the multi-speaker
[Microsoft VibeVoice samples](https://microsoft.github.io/VibeVoice/),
through `vibevoice-cli asr` with the Q4_K-quantized 7B model. RTF is
inference time / audio duration; lower is faster.

| Sample        | Audio duration | Backend / hardware         | Model | Load time | Inference | RTF       |
|---------------|---------------:|----------------------------|-------|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| `2p_argument` | 68.5 s         | CPU - AMD Ryzen 9950X3D    | Q4_K  | 5.9 s     | 150.4 s   | **2.195** |
| `2p_argument` | 68.5 s         | CUDA - NVIDIA GB10         | Q4_K  | 2.2 s     | 28.0 s    | **0.408** |

Sample transcripts and timing are produced by `vibevoice-cli asr ... 2>&1 | grep "asr: timing"`
(timing breakdown was added in the same release as the backend dispatch).
Reproduce locally:

```bash
hf download mudler/vibevoice.cpp-models --local-dir models
ffmpeg -i sample.mp3 -ac 1 -ar 24000 sample.wav
VIBEVOICE_BACKEND=cuda ./build/bin/vibevoice-cli asr \
    --model models/vibevoice-asr-q4_k.gguf \
    --tokenizer models/tokenizer.gguf \
    --audio sample.wav --max-new-tokens 8192
```

## Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure   # 21 ctest targets
```

For the real-weight tests:

```bash
VIBEVOICE_MODEL=models/vibevoice-realtime-0.5B.gguf \
VIBEVOICE_TOKENIZER=models/tokenizer.gguf \
  ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -j 2
```

## Embedding from Go (purego)

`vibevoice.cpp` ships a flat C ABI in [`include/vibevoice_capi.h`](include/vibevoice_capi.h)
designed for `dlopen` / `purego.RegisterLibFunc` consumers. It mirrors
the layout LocalAI's `qwen3-tts-cpp` Go backend uses:

```c
int  vv_capi_load(const char* tts_model, const char* asr_model,
                  const char* tokenizer, const char* voice, int n_threads);
// `voice_path` is for realtime-0.5B, `ref_audio_path` is for 1.5B
// (runtime voice cloning); pass NULL for whichever the loaded model
// doesn't need.
int  vv_capi_tts(const char* text, const char* voice_path, const char* ref_audio_path,
                 const char* dst_wav, int steps, float cfg, int max_speech_frames,
                 uint32_t seed);
int  vv_capi_asr(const char* src_wav, char* out_json, size_t out_capacity,
                 int max_new_tokens);
void vv_capi_unload(void);
```

Build the shared library and call it from Go:

```go
import "github.com/ebitengine/purego"

var (
    Load     func(tts, asr, tok, voice string, threads int) int
    TTS      func(text, voice, refAudio, dst string, steps int, cfg float32, maxFrames int, seed uint32) int
    ASR      func(src string, out []byte, outCap uint64, maxTok int) int
    Unload   func()
)

lib, _ := purego.Dlopen("./libvibevoice.so", purego.RTLD_NOW|purego.RTLD_GLOBAL)
purego.RegisterLibFunc(&Load,   lib, "vv_capi_load")
purego.RegisterLibFunc(&TTS,    lib, "vv_capi_tts")
purego.RegisterLibFunc(&ASR,    lib, "vv_capi_asr")
purego.RegisterLibFunc(&Unload, lib, "vv_capi_unload")
```

Build the shared library with `cmake -DVIBEVOICE_SHARED=ON`.

## Why

VibeVoice's official runtime is Python + Transformers + a vLLM plugin. `vibevoice.cpp` provides:

- A native CPU runtime with no Python at inference time
- Free CUDA / Metal / Vulkan support via ggml backends
- A single `.gguf` weight file + a single binary
- A flat C ABI (`include/vibevoice_capi.h`) for embedding via dlopen / purego / cgo

## Build

```bash
git clone --recursive https://example.com/vibevoice.cpp
cd vibevoice.cpp
cmake -B build -DVIBEVOICE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Layout
